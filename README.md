# Simulations & Modeling
This repository has projects of simulations and modeling using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## Projects
- üè® [Hotel Simulation](https://github.com/sindibejko/simulations-modeling/tree/main/Hotel%20Simulation): simulates the behavior of guests in a hotel environment, including checking in, luggage handling, visiting restaurant or bar, room service, and checking out. Simulation records behavior and time spent on each task.
- üö¶ [Traffic Simulation](https://github.com/sindibejko/simulations-modeling/tree/main/Traffic%20Simulation): simulates traffic flow on a 5x5 grid of roads with traffic lights, includes a mechanism to prevent cars from moving simultaneously through intersecting roads.
- üëî [Busy Office Simulation](https://github.com/sindibejko/simulations-modeling/tree/main/Busy%20Office%20Simulation): simulation of the behavior of employees in a busy office environment, including tasks such as typing on a computer, making phone calls, or taking breaks.
- üóÉ [Classroom Simulation](https://github.com/sindibejko/simulations-modeling/tree/main/Classroom%20Simulation): simulates a classroom environment with 50 students and 2 teachers. Generates a report of students who have raised their hands and given presentations and those who have not.
