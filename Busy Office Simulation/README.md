This project simulates the behavior of employees in a busy office environment using multithreading in Python. Each employee performs tasks such as typing on a computer, making phone calls, or taking breaks. The simulation records the behavior and time spent on each task.

# Features
- Simulates multiple employees performing different tasks concurrently.
- Tracks and records the time spent by each employee on their tasks.
- Generates a report of the simulation, detailing the tasks and the total time spent on each.

# Classes and Methods
- **Employee Class**: Represents an employee performing various tasks in a simulated office environment.
- **Simulator Class**: Manages the simulation of the office environment, including the behavior and activity tracking of multiple employees.


To run the simulation, you create an instance of the '**_Simulator_**' class with the desired number of employees and call the '**_start_**' method, followed by the '**_getReport_**' method. 

This project simulates 5 employees and generates a report of their activities.
